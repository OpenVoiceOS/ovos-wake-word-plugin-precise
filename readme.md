## Description
This adds a plugin for precise, this is the official mycroft wake word 
engine and is supported out of the box by core, however i have some issues 
with the official implementation that i try to solve with this

- the downloading of binaries is messy, i prefer that the download blocks 
  instead of reloading the listener
- mycroft-core keeps replacing and redownloading binary whenever you test a 
  new model from a different version, i want to support having both versions 
  side by side
  - i support [multiple wakeword at same time](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/1233)
- xdg compliant paths
- allow overriding binary used
- fix recording of wake words setting, this is derived from phonemes and 
  badly implemented in core, so you end up with issues like getting 0.2 second 
  recordings if you don't set the phonemes (that are not used by precise)
- i prefer hardcoded static and explicit urls for binary to be downloaded

The "plugins" are pip install-able modules that provide new engines for mycroft

more info in the [docs](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/mycroft-technologies/mycroft-core/plugins)

## Install

`pip install ovos-wake-word-plugin-precise`

Configure your wake word in mycroft.conf

```json
 "listener": {
      "wake_word": "android"
 },
 "hotwords": {
    "android": {
        "module": "ovos_ww_precise",
        "version": "0.3",
        "model": "path/to/your/model"
    }
  }
 
```

Advanced configuration

```json
 "listener": {
      "wake_word": "android"
 },
 "hotwords": {
    "android": {
        "module": "ovos_ww_precise",
        "trigger_level": 3,
        "sensitivity": 0.5,
        "version": "0.3",
        "model": "path/or/url/to/your/model",
        "binary_path": "path/to/your/binary/eg/using/tflite",
        "expected_duration": 3
    }
  }
 
```


- `binary_path` if you want to use your own binary, eg for use with 
  [tflite branch](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise/pull/141)
- `version` defaults to 0.2, only 0.2 and 0.3 supported (ignored if binary path is set)
- `model` full path to your model file, if it's an url the model will be 
  downloaded to a XDG directory
- `trigger_level` Higher = more delay & less sensitive
- `sensitivity`  Higher = more sensitive
- `expected_duration` defaults to 3 seconds (max value), this is the time 
  used for [saving wake word samples](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/blob/4c84f66e15a361d9f3d650def1ba97fa80506456/mycroft/configuration/mycroft.conf#L160)
